# VALORANT-Global-Stats-Calculator
This is a simple python program I made to parse official riot VALORANT game logs. I have done my best to document the program so it is easy to use for yourself. In the repo I have included documentation to make this easy to use for yourself, or just try it out with my example match history. Yes this is my match history, and yes I know my stats aren't great for 2.5k hours. But if like myself you are curious how you actually statistically match up, get your own match history and run the match history parser!

**To get your match history you need to file for an official request of information from riot games support**
